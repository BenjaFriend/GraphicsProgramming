# Found. of Game Graphics Programming (IGME 540), Fall 2018

This repo contains my classwork for my Game Graphics class at RIT with Professor Chris Cascioli.

We were provided with a "core" framework to build upon throughout the semester. 

The starter code included initial versions of: 
* `DXCore` class
* `Game` class
* `Main.cpp`
* `SimpleShader` class
* `PixelShader.hlsl` and `VertexShader.hlsl`

> 
> The goal of this course is to explore the use of an advanced graphics API to access hadrd-ware accelerated graphics in a real-time graphics engine context.
